#listening unlimited

**copyright notice**

this is an open source project free to use however you wish. there is no music in it, only code for software to help download music.

**unlimited library**

the listen unlimited bundle comes with a library server which uses the [genius](https://genius.com/) to discover published song titles. any artist, album, or song that is on genius can be found in the library. When you play a song or queue it up, the library will download the song audio. Listen unlimited will use youtube to download songs. this is accomplished using a headless chromium browser extended to record the webpage content, so it is your responsibility to make sure any music acquired in this format is public domain. furthermore, if you do not have youtube red then midroll ads may be captured if the publisher enables them. the captured audio for a song may be trimmed. there is no violation of google TOS because the queueing of a download requires human action and because it does not automate the process but rather records the browser while a video plays off screen. it is your responsibility to respect the specific terms of the content publisher...all of that said this software is used to make local copies of music usually released under complex studio licensing agreements. i use it for unrelease juice wrld songs which would go unheard for eternity if it weren't for the copyright infringement of individuals. nobody is going to come after my collection of songs unless i were to start distributing my audio files, it was youtube's original responsibility to make sure they did not distribute them to me. publishers want to maintain control over how their content is used. if they did not want anyone to listen to the songs for free they would not distribute them on youtube. please do not use this application for the mass redistribution of content. this will only discourage record companies from continuing to allow us the privilege of free song listening on youtube

**listen anywhere**

your library is hosted on a server which can means you can listen from the browser, a desktop app, or a mobile app no matter where you are as long as your server is running on a port forwarded network. if you like, each listen unlimited client may sync with the server to always have the entire library downloaded and ready to listen offline
